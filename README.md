## General Information:

A semester long project for Advanced Software Development. This project was developed using a modified Agile development method, and was primarily made using the Django framework. This implementation of Civic Connect aims to help make the prospect of contacting your representatives a little bit less daunting. It allows users to access contact information about their represenatives based on their address and browse a set of community sourced templates with all the information they need to contact them.
